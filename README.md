# triangle()

In this assignment, you will be creating functions **triangleFor** and **triangleWhile**.  The input to each will be a number corresponding to the number of rows of the triangle.  Your goal is to print a one-sided triangle of hashmarks with the expected number of rows. To do this, you will use 'for' loops in **triangleFor** and 'while' loops in **triangleWhile**.
